- all prerequisites will be installed on the instances via user-data scripts for each tier (docker, docker-compose and others)

CI/CD Should perform;
- clone the repositories respectively (blog-database, blog-backend, blog-frontned)
- cd into the cloned repository 
- run Docker Compose lifecycle commands 


cat ~/.ssh/ec2-github-actions.pub


Would you like me to:

Customize the script (e.g., build volumes, logs)?

Add rollback or error handling?

adding logging, slack/discord notifications
